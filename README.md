## About this font

I wanted there to be a better Calvin and Hobbes font (for memes on r/okbuddyrosalyn), so I started making one last year. I told everyone that I would share it when I was done. Unfortunately, I don't actually know anything about making fonts. There were issues and improvements that I didn't know how to fix/add. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I left it at 80% complete for 6 months. But I have finally decided to post it in all its unfinished and imperfect glory! It should fulfill the needs of your memes.

## Help me improve it

I built this font with Font Forge, following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O4bIAzbebI) from this incredibly helpful 12 year old. I highly recommend it.

If anyone is skilled enough to improve this font, be my guest. That's why I included the `WatterSans.sfd`. Here are some of its failures as I see it:

- I added ligatures for common double letters (`oo`, `tt`, etc) so that it would look more handwritten. But for some reason, they don't seem to work outside of Font Forge.
- !\[This image demonstrates how the ligatures are meant to look](https://github.com/Caleb-Barton/WatterSans/blob/main/images/img\_2.png?raw=true)
- There are also a bunch of errors that it says I should fix that I don't understand.
  - Non-integral coordinates
  - Self intersecting
  - Missing POints at Extrema
  - Private dictionary missing blueValues entry

I don't want to post this font to a font sharing website until I have resolved some of these errors.
