Hey nerds!

I wanted there to be a better Calvin and Hobbes font, so I started making one last year. I told everyone that I would share it when I was done. But I don't actually know much about making fonts, and there were issues and improvements that I didn't know how to fix/add. So I got busy with school and never got around to completing it. But I've wanted to post it for a while. So I finally decided to post it, in all it's imperfect glory!

I built this font with Font Forge, following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O4bIAzbebI) from this incredibly helpful 12 year old. I highly recommend it. If you just want to download the font for your use, you just need the `WatterSans\_Regular.otf`. Google how to install it for your operating system.

...But if anyone knows more about fonts, feel free to improve the `WatterSans.sfd` file. Here is what it seems to need:

I added ligatures for common double letters (`oo`, `tt`, etc) so that it would look more handwritten. But for some reason, they don't seem to work outside of Font Forge. There are also a bunch of errors that it says I should fix that I don't know how to.
